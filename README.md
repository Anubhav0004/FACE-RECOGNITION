# FACE-RECOGNITION
The face recognition is a technique to identify or verify the face from the digital images or video frame.
OpenCV is a video and image processing library and it is used for image and video analysis, like facial detection, license plate reading, photo editing, advanced robotic vision, and many more.
This face recognition system first performs face detection, extract face embeddings from each face using deep learning, train a face recognition model on the embeddings, and then finally recognize faces in video streams with OpenCV.
